k-map

Description

k-mappability is a fast C++11 library implementing an algorithm . The time complexity of the implemented algorithm is O(n) time and space  for  integer alphabets of size Ïƒ if m = Î©((log_Ïƒ(n)).

Requirements

A 64-bit GNU/Linux (or MAC) operating system.
A C++11 ready compiler such as g++ version 4.9 or higher.
